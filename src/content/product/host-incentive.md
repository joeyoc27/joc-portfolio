## The Challenge
Expedia Group has a vast network of travelers, but we don't effectively convert them into vacation rental hosts. We aim to launch an incentive program to acquire new hosts and create a host-to-host referral system to tap into this existing user base.

## Key Insights
- Airbnb already offers a robust rewards program that serves as a proven driver for low-cost, high-quality leads and long-term loyalty.
- There's a relatively low overlap between Travelers and Hosts. Vrbo Hosts who travel with EG have 52% higher GBV than non-host travelers.

## Solution
We designed a host acquisition program offering OneKeyCash rewards to new hosts upon reaching listing and booking milestones. The program includes both direct incentives for new hosts and a referral system allowing existing hosts to earn additional rewards.

## Impact
Opportunity sizing of $12.2MM eRMD and gain of 15k incremental global new listings in the first 12 months. 

## Learnings
- <span class="hover-orange">Do the right thing</span>: Applied game theory thinking to prevent bad actors from gaming the incentive system.
- <span class="hover-orange">Get your work across the finish line:</span> Navigated complex legal, compliance, and technical challenges to launch the rewards program. 
    - Earned cross-EG recognition from Incentive Platform lead for building POC data stream to unblock the program.
