## The Challenge
Vrbo's primary internal admin tool (Trips Admin) was built on Adobe ColdFusion, creating significant security vulnerabilities and maintenence costs due to the outdated technology stack. With limited resources, we needed to rebuild the application while strategically prioritizing which functionality to maintain versus deprecate.

## Key Insights
- Limited capacity: We only had one developer for one quarter able to execute on this.
- Trips Admin is used daily by thousands of EG employees spanning Customer Support, Partner Success, Sales, and Engineering. 
- Authentication integration was the most complex challenge due to Expedia Group's fragmented auth systems across different user types.

## Solution
We strategically stripped the tool of low-usage features and rebuilt core functionality on a modern tech stack. The streamlined application was successfully delivered by the end of the quarter, focusing resources on essential admin capabilities while eliminating security vulnerabilities.

## Impact
- Tool was rebuilt on modern tech stack, paving way for low-cost improvements in future. 
- Previous risk of brownouts was fully eliminated.
