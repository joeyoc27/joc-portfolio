## The Challenge
Brief context on the problem you were solving (2-3 sentences max). Keep it high-level without exposing sensitive company details.
The Sign-up (List Your Property) is the top of EG's Lodging Onboarding funnel. Due to a stable core onboarding conversion, any conversion improvement here translates to an increase in onboarding volume. 

## Key Insights
- First key insight about the problem
- Second key insight from user research
- Third critical finding that shaped approach
- When I first joined the team, there were lots of low hanging fruit. Copy and branding was bland and basic components like FAQs, video testimonials, and clear CTAs were missing. My first priority was introducing these before moving on to more interesting experiments. 

## Solution
Created repeatable framework for launching a/b tests to increase experimentation velocity. Migrated content layer to Adobe Experience Manager to reduce engineering load for minor content updates, freeing up capacity for more complex enhancements. 

## Impact
- 250 basis point conversion uplift across Vrbo and Expedia List Your Property pages.
- Introduced complementary revenue source via Property Management Referral partnerships with Vacasa and AvantStay, capturing previously blocked inventory and generating ongoing revenue share from qualified lead referrals.
- 

## Learnings
Be curious to learn and grow - Brainstorming great a/b tests requires keeping an ear to the ground and going into tests with an open mind. 
Get your work across the finish line & communicate clearly - Getting test launched quickly requires shepharding across various teams -- engineering, marketing, design, analytics, legal.
