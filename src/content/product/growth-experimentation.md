## The Challenge
The sign-up page (List Your Property) drives EG's property acquisition pipeline. With stable core onboarding performance, conversion improvements at this funnel entry point translate directly to measurable business growth.

## Key Insights
Upon joining, I identified fundamental gaps: bland copy/branding and missing core conversion elements like FAQs, video testimonials, and clear CTAs. Implementing these foundational improvements became the priority before advancing to complex experiments.

Following this baseline work, I collaborated with sales and support teams to identify and resolve key customer pain points, accelerating time-to-go-live. 



## Solution
Built scalable A/B testing framework to systematically increase experimentation velocity while reducing engineering bottlenecks. Migrated content management to Adobe Experience Manager, enabling non-technical teams to execute minor updates independently and freeing engineering capacity for high-impact feature development.

## Impact
- Achieved 250+ basis point conversion uplift across Vrbo and Expedia List Your Property pages.
- Introduced complementary revenue source via Property Management Referral partnerships with Vacasa and AvantStay, capturing previously blocked inventory and generating ongoing revenue share from qualified lead referrals.
- 

## Learnings
- Be curious to learn and grow: Effective A/B testing requires staying close to customer feedback and approaching each experiment with an open mind about potential outcomes.
- Get your work across the finish line and communicate clearly: Rapid test deployment depends on coordinating across engineering, marketing, design, analytics, and legal teams to maintain momentum.
