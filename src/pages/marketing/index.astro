				<h1>Marketing</h1>
				
				<p class="intro">
					In college, I co-founded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211230180644/https://decoromedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decoro Media</a> with three friends. Decoro was an all-inclusive advertising and direct response marketing solution for info products and course creators. After we all got full-time jobs, we eventually sunset the business. A couple of us took the profits and began testing ecom affiliate campaigns in our free time. <a href="https://syncniva.com/products/nightclear%E2%84%A2-advanced-led-headlight-glasses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SyncNiva</a> is an example of a brand we have ran in the past. Shortly after, I found some success in lead gen (pay-per-call) affiliate. However, the fragile, house-of-cards nature of the business meant constant scrambling to rebuild what competitors and platform changes kept knocking down. I wanted to grow a more sustainable career and shut down operations to focus 100% on Expedia.
